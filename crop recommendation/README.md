<h2>üìù Abstract:</h2><br>
<p>
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in India and the farmers are one of the most essential members of society. In India Agriculture plays a predominant role in the economy and employment. One of the major problems among Indian farmers is that they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. Due to this farmers face many problems in the productivity of crops. This problem has been addressed through precision agriculture.
</p>
<p>
Precision agriculture is a trend now-a-days. It helps the farmers to take the decision about the farming strategy. Precision Agriculture is a strategy that uses data such as soil characteristics and climate data to suggest the crop to be grown. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and IoT can help in this task. IoT sensors captures the soil characteristics and weather data, this data can be used to build a Deep Learning model which can recommend the most suitable crops to grow on a particular farm. This can help farmers to make decisions on which crops to grow on their farm.

<h2>üìù About the project</h2><br>
<h4>The Project is about building an Artificial Neural Network model and creating the web application that recommends farmers the best crop which is suitable for their farm. This is a clasification model with 22 different classes.</h4><br>
1. N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil<br>
2. P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil<br>
3. K - ratio of Potassium content in soil<br>
4. temperature - temperature in degree Celsius<br>
5. humidity - relative humidity in %<br>
6. ph - ph value of the soil<br>
7. rainfall - rainfall in mm<br><br>

<h2>üóÑÔ∏è About the Data:</h2><br>
<h3> Dataset used for the project:<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset'> Crop Recommendation Data</a><br></h3>
Dataset consists of 8 columns in which 7 columns are the characteristics of the soil and the last column is the label column which consists of crop name.<br><br>
